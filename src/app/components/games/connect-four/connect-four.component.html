            <strong>Rules of Connect Four</strong>
            <hr>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Game Board:</strong> The game is played on a vertical grid with 7 columns and 6 rows.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Players:</strong> The game is played between two players. One player uses red markers, and
                    the other player uses yellow markers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Objective:</strong> The objective of the game is to be the first player to connect four of
                    their markers (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) in a straight line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Starting Player:</strong> The player using red markers typically starts the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Turns:</strong> Players take turns dropping their markers into any column of the grid. The
                    marker falls to the lowest available empty cell in the selected column.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gameplay:</strong> On their turn, each player drops one of their markers into any column of
                    the grid. Players continue taking turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Winning:</strong> A player wins the game if they successfully connect four of their markers
                    (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) in a straight line. The game ends immediately when
                    a player achieves this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Draw:</strong> If all cells on the grid are filled with markers, and no player has connected
                    four markers in a row, the game ends in a draw.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Replay:</strong> After the game ends (either in a win or draw), players have the option to
                    replay the game if they wish to continue playing.
                </li>

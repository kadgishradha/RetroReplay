            <strong>Rules of Tic Tac Toe</strong>
            <hr>
            <ol>
                <li>Objective: The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form a
                    horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your symbols (X or O) in a row.</li>
                <li>Players: The game is typically played by two players, who take turns placing their symbol (X or O)
                    in an empty cell of the grid.</li>
                <li>Starting the Game: The game starts with an empty grid.</li>
                <li>Taking Turns: Players take turns alternately. The player using X usually goes first.</li>
                <li>Placing Symbols: On your turn, you place your symbol (X or O) into an empty cell of the grid.</li>
                <li>Winning: If a player succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or
                    diagonal row, that player wins the game.</li>
                <li>Draw (Tie): If all cells are filled and no player has formed a winning line, the game is a draw
                    (tie).</li>
